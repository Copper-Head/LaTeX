LaTeX
=====

A collection of templates, bib files and whatever else I find useful related to LaTeX

The master.bib file contains all the references I inherited from Rajesh Bhatt and Kyle Johnson as well as all the references I have ever been in need of myself.

The 'templates' directory contains the various templates I currently use. More information about each one is found in the corresponding file.
